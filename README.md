IcyDwarf
========
*IcyDwarf* calculates the coupled physical-chemical evolution of an icy dwarf planet or moon. As of version 16.3, the code calculates:
- The thermal evolution of an icy dwarf planet, with no chemistry, but with rock hydration, dehydration, hydrothermal circulation, core cracking, tidal heating, and porosity. The depth of cracking and a bulk water:rock ratio by mass in the rocky core are also computed.
- Whether cryovolcanism is possible by the exsolution of volatiles from cryolavas.
- Equilibrium fluid and rock chemistries resulting from water-rock interaction in subsurface oceans in contact with a rocky core, up to 200ÂºC and 1000 bar.

*IcyDwarfPlot* creates interactive displays of outputs from the following *IcyDwarf* functionalities:
- Thermal Evolution
- Core cracking
- Equilibrium fluid and rock compositions.

There is currently no display of cryovolcanism or geochemistry outputs from *IcyDwarf*.

The two codes can run independently of each other, so it's not necessary to install both if you only need one.

# Installation

The installation steps outlined below are valid for Mac OS 10.9+. *IcyDwarf* and *IcyDwarfPlot* could also run on Windows and Linux, but compilation instructions are not set up and external I/O handling needs to be modified in the source code. 

## Install *R*
*R* is needed only for *IcyDwarf*, to run the geochemistry package *CHNOSZ*.
Go to http://www.r-project.org and follow instructions.

## Install *CHNOSZ*
*CHNOSZ* is needed only for *IcyDwarf*. Open *R* using either the installed application icon or in a terminal by typing

	R
	
In *R*, type the command

	install.packages(CHNOSZ)

## Install *Rcpp* and *RInside*
*Rcpp* and *RInside* are libraries that allow *R* applications to be embedded in C or C++ codes. They are needed only for *IcyDwarf*. Go to http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html and http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RInside/index.html to download the respective archives. On Mac, unzip the archives in */Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library/*, so that *Rcpp* and *RInside* are two subfolders of *library*.

## Install *IPHREEQC*
The *IPHREEQC* library is a module that allows the *PHREEQC* application to be embedded in C or C++ codes. It is needed only for *IcyDwarf*. Go to http://wwwbrr.cr.usgs.gov/projects/GWC_coupled/phreeqc to download *IPHREEQC* and follow the default installation instructions:

	./configure
	make
	make install

## Install *gcc 5.0*
In recent Mac versions (OS 10.8+), the Mac compiler *clang* has replaced the compiler *gcc*, which is needed to take advantage of the parallel computing capabilities of the *ParamExploration()* routine of *IcyDwarf*. Go to http://hpc.sourceforge.net and follow the instructions there to download and install *gcc 5.0*.
Once *gcc 5.0* is installed, you might need to break the symbolic link between the command 

    gcc 

and *clang* by typing:

    alias gcc=/usr/local/bin/gcc

## Install *SDL2*
*SDL2* is a graphic library, needed only for *IcyDwarfPlot*. Go to http://www.libsdl.org/projects. Download and install *SDL2*, *SDL2_image*, and *SDL2_ttf*. *SDL2_mixer* is not needed as the code doesn't play music for you yet.

## Install *IcyDwarf*
Go to https://github.com/MarcNeveu/IcyDwarf. Click *Download ZIP* on the bottom right side of the page. Unzip IcyDwarf-master.zip. Rename the unzipped folder *IcyDwarf-master* to *IcyDwarf*.
Move the renamed *IcyDwarf* folder to any folder you would like, we will call it *Path_to_GitFolder* here. All source files should be in: 
- */Path_to_GitFolder/IcyDwarf/IcyDwarf* and subfolders
- */Path_to_GitFolder/IcyDwarf/IcyDwarfPlot* and subfolders

# Running the code

## Start the code
The executable files are:
- */Path_to_GitFolder/IcyDwarf/IcyDwarf/Release/IcyDwarf* (no extension)
- */Path_to_GitFolder/IcyDwarf/IcyDwarfPlot/Release/IcyDwarfPlot* (no extension)

## Input files
The respective input files are located in the *IcyDwarf/Input* and *IcyDwarfPlot/Input* folders.

## Output files

### Thermal code

The output file of the thermal evolution code is *Thermal.txt*. It lists, for a given layer inside a dwarf planet:
- radius (km)
- temperature (K)
- mass of rock (g)
- mass of water ice (g)
- mass of ammonia dihydrate (g)
- mass of liquid water (g)
- mass of liquid ammonia (g)
- Nusselt number in the ice shell (if >1, the shell convects)
- fraction of amorphous ice (currently set to 0)
- thermal conductivity (W/m/K)
- degree of hydration (0: fully dry, 1: fully hydrated)

The first *n_layer* lines list these properties in each layer, from the center to the surface, at *t*=0. The next *n_layer* lines list them at *t+dt_output*, and so on, such that the total number of lines is *n_layer* * *n_output*.

### Cracking code

The crack routine outputs three files: 
- *Crack_depth.txt* (two columns: time in Gyr, depth of cracked zone in km)
- *Crack_WRratio.txt* (two columns: time in Gyr, water:rock ratio by mass in cracked zone)
- *Crack.txt* (*n_layer* columns, *n_output* rows, each value is an integer: 0 = no cracks; 1 = cracks from thermal contraction; 2 = cracks from thermal expansion; 3 = cracks from hydration; 4 = cracks from dehydration; 5 = cracks from pore water dilation; 6 = mineral dissolution widening; 7 = mineral precipitation shrinking; -1 = mineral precipitation clogging.

All thermal and crack output files can be read and displayed by *IcyDwarfPlot*.

### Cryolava code

The cryolava routine outputs three files: 
- *Cryolava_molalities.txt* (10 columns, *n_ice_or_crust_layer* rows) shows the cryolava content in H2, CH4, CH3OH, CO, CO2, NH3, N2, H2S, SO2, Ar in mol per kg of liquid water
- *Cryolava_partialP.txt*, with the same layout as the molalities file, shows the partial pressure of each of these 10 species
- *Cryolava_xvap.txt* has the same amount of rows, but only 6 columns which show the depth under the surface (km), total gas pressure (bar), volumic vapor fraction x_vap (a dimensionless indicator of exsolution),  fluid cryolava density (kg m-3), stress intensity K_I at the crack tip (Pa m^0.5), a boolean (0: no crack propagation; 1: crack propagation).

### ParamExploration code

This routine outputs a file that looks much like the *PHREEQC* selected output specified in the *IcyDwarf/PHREEQC-3.1.2/io* folder, with a few added columns at the beginning (starting T in celsius, P in bar, pH, pe, log fO2 at FMQ(T,P) buffer, pe-FMQ). The file is formatted for easy import into a spreadsheet, with each line describing a different simulation. Lines filled with zeros are *PHREEQC* simulations that did not converge.

The *PHREEQC* input file, *IcyDwarf/PHREEQC-3.1.2/io/inputIcyDwarf*, can be modified, but be aware that *IcyDwarfPlot* will plot results accurately only if the SELECTED_OUTPUT block is left unchanged.

# Modifying the source code

If you wish to modify the code, set up your compiler and linker so that all the relevant flags are added. 

## Compiler setup (*gcc* on Mac OS 10.11 El Capitan)

My compiling instructions look like this:

For IcyDwarf:
 
    gcc -I/usr/local/lib/gcc/x86_64-apple-darwin14.0.0/5.0.0/include -I/usr/local/include -I/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.0/Resources/include -I/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.0/Resources/library/RInside/include -O3 -g -Wall -c -fmessage-length=0 -arch x86_64 -fopenmp -o IcyDwarf.o ../IcyDwarf.c
    gcc -L/Users/marc/Documents/Research/2011-2016_ASU/2IcyDwarf/Git/IcyDwarf/IcyDwarf -L/usr/local/lib -L/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.2/Resources/lib -o IcyDwarf IcyDwarf.o /usr/local/lib/libiphreeqc-3.1.7.dylib /usr/local/lib/libiphreeqc.dylib /usr/local/lib/libiphreeqc.a -lgomp -lR

For IcyDwarfPlot:

    gcc -I/usr/include -I/Library/Frameworks/SDL2.framework/Versions/A/Headers -I/Library/Frameworks/SDL2_image.framework/Versions/A/Headers -I/Library/Frameworks/SDL2_ttf.framework/Versions/A/Headers -I/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/Cocoa.framework/Versions/A/Headers -I/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/GLUT.framework/Versions/A/Headers -I/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/Versions/A/Headers -O3 -Wall -c -fmessage-length=0 -o IcyDwarfPlot.o ../IcyDwarfPlot.c 
    gcc -L/Users/marc/Documents/Research/2011-2016_ASU/2IcyDwarf/Git/IcyDwarf/IcyDwarfPlot -F/Library/Frameworks -arch x86_64 -framework openGL -framework Cocoa -framework GLUT -framework SDL2 -framework SDL2_image -framework SDL2_ttf -o IcyDwarfPlot IcyDwarfPlot.o 

You might need to specify the full path to gcc (e.g. */usr/local/bin/gcc*) rather than simply the *gcc* alias.

Your *include* directories might be more simply found at *-I/usr/include*.
